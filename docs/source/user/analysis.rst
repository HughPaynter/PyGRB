Application to Gravitational Lensing
====================================

This software package was created with the intent to discern similar looking gamma-ray bursts from statistically identical gamma-ray bursts.
A pair of statistically identical gamma-ray bursts would be indicative of a gravitational lensing event.

The material presented here is supplementary to a research paper currently out to review.
These scripts, using the *PyGRB* package, allow the reader to reproduce the results of the paper (with enough computational power).
